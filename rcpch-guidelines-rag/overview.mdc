# RCPCH Guidelines RAG Pipeline Overview

This project provides a Python-based pipeline to scrape, process, and embed clinical guidelines from the RCPCH website, specifically starting from the ADHD heading. The processed data is intended for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, enabling advanced search and question-answering over the guidelines.

## Key Features
- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes Python and BeautifulSoup to extract guideline content from https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/clinical-guideline-directory#adhd.
- **Chunking & Embeddings:** Leverages LangChain utilities and sentence-transformers to split content into chunks and generate vector embeddings.
- **Vector Store:** Stores embeddings in a ChromaDB vector database, which is accessible as a service via Docker Compose.
- **Dockerized:** The entire pipeline, including the scraper and vector store, runs in isolated Docker containers for reproducibility and easy deployment.

## Architecture
- **Python App:** Handles scraping, chunking, and embedding. Can be extended for further RAG tasks. IMPORTANT: uses `uv` for venv management
- **ChromaDB:** Runs as a service for storing and querying vector embeddings.
- **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates the Python app and ChromaDB, ensuring seamless communication between services.

## Usage
1. Build and start the services:
   ```sh
   s/up
   ```
2. The Python app will scrape, process, and store guideline data in ChromaDB, ready for RAG workflows.
